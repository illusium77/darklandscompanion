# Game Companion
Attaches to the game process while playing to read values directly from the memory. Unfortunately this means that it will probably only work with the English Steam version of the game running in Dosbox-emulator.
Shows clue book saint descriptions when learning new saints in churches, monasteries, etc.
During the encounters, companion will show the saints which could help solve the problem (even if they are not yet known by anyone in the party).
Implement 'saint finder' so user can find known saints based on the attribute/skill it enhances and things like water walking or improvement to local reputation.
Display the quality levels of alchemy recipes when buying new ones.
